# EmoteWheel
Emote Wheel POC made with rust + egui for NieR: Automata


This is based off of sy1ntexx's egui-d3d11 repo (https://github.com/sy1ntexx/egui-d3d11/) using their template.
It has no functionality, it only exists as an example of egui in d3d11.

## Installation
Install as a `LATE` load plugin for nier-mod-loader as per its instructions: https://github.com/xxk-i/Nier-Mod-Loader.

## Assets
The assets used by this mod can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20230616174121/https://imgur.com/a/Pz0JOFe

## Building
Unfortunately, it seems the egui-d3d11 repo and respective crates have been taken down by the owner, so this cannot be built from source anymore. This repo does not contain egui-d3d11 files aside from a modified lib.rs from the example-wnd directory.
